# AspNetConventions

![AspNetConventions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keizrivas/AspNetConventions/main/assets/asp_net_conventions.png)

**Convention-driven standardization for ASP.NET Core** - Automatically applies consistent standardization across ASP.NET Core applications — including APIs, MVC, and Razor Pages — with minimal configuration and zero boilerplate.

## Why AspNetConventions?

We believe API building should be intuitive. [AspNetConventions](https://github.com/keizrivas/AspNetConventions) transforms standard ASP.NET setups into a modern API solution by applying smart global behaviors automatically:

- **Universal Endpoint Support** - Consistent URL structure across MVC, Minimal APIs, and Razor Pages.
- **Automatic Route standardization** - Route and parameter names are transformed and bound automatically follow your preferred casing style.
- **Standardized responses** - Uniform JSON formatting and consistent response formatting application-wide.
- **Global exception handling** - Centralized error handling and formatting throughout your codebase.
- **Fully Extensible** - Supports custom converters, mappers, hooks, and response formatters, as well as third-party library compatibility.
- **Zero Runtime Overhead** - Conventions are applied during application startup, no performance impact on requests.
